# Time-Series-Analysis-Forecasting
This repository is a personal learning journey through the world of time series analysis and forecasting. It serves as a showcase of my progression from basic techniques to more advanced methodologies in this crucial field of data science.
Repository Aims:
  1-To document my learning process in time series analysis
  2-To implement various forecasting techniques, from simple to complex
  3-To develop a comprehensive understanding of time-based data patterns
  4-To create a portfolio of practical, real-world time series projects
What You'll Find Here:
  1-Python scripts for various forecasting models
  2-Datasets used in projects (or links to data sources)
  3-Documentation of insights and lessons learned
  4-Comparisons of different forecasting techniques
Topics Covered (Evolving):
  * Basic time series decomposition
  * Moving averages and exponential smoothing
  * ARIMA/X and SARIMA/X models

This repository will grow and evolve as I progress in my learning journey. Feedback, suggestions, and collaborations are always welcome!
